          <h2>About Us</h2>
          <p>
               Salem Hetzel's Church has roots reaching back to the late 18th 
               century. Early church records show baptisms and congregational activity beginning around 1783, reflecting the presence 
               of both Lutheran and German Reformed families who worshiped together in a traditional Pennsylvania Union 
               Church arrangement. Over time, the Reformed congregation became part of what is known today as the United Church of 
               Christ (UCC), the modern successor to the German Reformed tradition.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
               Throughout the 18th and 19th centuries, the church served as a central gathering place for the rural Washington Township
                community. Archival records—including baptismal, marriage, and burial registers—document a continuous and active 
                congregation from 1783 through the late 1800s, illustrating the church's role in supporting generations of families 
                in the community. These records are preserved in genealogical collections and historical archives.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
               By the mid-19th century, Salem Hetzel's Church had become firmly established, with both the Lutheran and UCC 
               congregations sharing the building and maintaining the long-standing Union Church tradition. 
               Collections held by the Evangelical & UCC Historical Society include church bulletins, cemetery inscriptions 
               dating back to 1739, pastoral records, and anniversary materials, all of which highlight the church's enduring 
               presence and evolving ministries.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
               Across the street from the sanctuary lies the historic Hetzel's Church Cemetery, one of the oldest in the area. 
               The cemetery contains the graves of early settlers and long-standing members of the congregation, and it is 
               frequently referenced in genealogical and preservation records under names such as Hetzels Church Cemetery.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
               Today, Salem Hetzel's Church continues its mission of worship, fellowship, and community service, building on more 
               than two centuries of shared faith and tradition with its new pastor Paul Cronin. Its history reflects the 
               perseverance and devotion of the families who established and sustained it, making it one of the enduring spiritual 
               landmarks of Pine Grove, Pennsylvania.
