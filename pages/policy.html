                    members. This includes emails or postal mailings for events and activities related to the church. We may use your

               <h1>Personal Information on Children</h1>

                    The Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (“COPPA”), 15 U.S.C. §§ 6501-6505, governs information collected

                     security measures. All personal data on our members is collected in person and kept in the church offices for
